## Features

- Choose format type for each map type

 - **DXT5** - Higher quality texture with transparency (alpha) but size is a bit bigger (just use this for most things really)
 
 - **DXT1** - No transparency format, also lowers the quality and can cause artifacts, smaller size than DXT5 though
 
 - **None** - Will not export that DDS texture
- Export only DDS (Skip/Delete PNGs on export)
- Help dialog if you are clueless
- Some other changes...

## Export preset (IMPORTANT): 
Move the GTA 5.spexp file to this folder: 
<pre>
C:\Users\username\Documents\Adobe\Adobe Substance 3D Painter\assets\export-presets
</pre>

OR

Make sure you use specific suffixes in your export template, like this:

## Enable the Starfield-DDS-Exporter under the Python menu
First time running the plugin it will ask you what folder the Texconv.exe is located in via a UI pop-up. This will create a Starfield-DDS-Exporter-PluginSettings.ini in the plugin folder with the settings saved.
